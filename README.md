# Don't be a square!
> A fun and interactive React app that lets users add, delete, and clear colored squares on a grid by using SquareAPI. Built with **React**, **CSS**, and **Vite**.

## ðŸ“¸ Example: Square Pattern Progression

Below is a visual demonstration of how the grid changes as squares are added:

### Adding Squares Step-by-Step

| Step 1 | Step 2 |
|--------|--------|

| Step 3 | Step 4 |
|--------|--------|
| ![Step 3](./examples/example-output-3.png) | ![Step 4](./examples/example-output-4.png) |

### After a few layers

> These images demonstrate how the grid expands as more squares are added, based on their `x` and `y` coordinates from the API.
